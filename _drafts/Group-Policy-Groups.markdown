Concise
-------

There are two types of group policy groups, security and distrobution. Distrobution groups are used for Exchange mailing lists and security groups are used for making logical groupings of Active Directory objects. There are 3 types of scopes, Global, local, and universal. Universals span domains so are not needed in a single domain environment. Global groups should combine logical objects and local should relate to a resource.

More Words
----------

I don't understand why global and local groups are recomended to be used they way they are.
