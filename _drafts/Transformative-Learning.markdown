What are the core values of education, and how can they be applied with modern technology and lean principals.

### Open Platform ###

A true leaning tool needs to have a lot of conent, to get the needed quanitity of content it must be an open format. Just as a single publisher could never compete with Wikipedia. The platform needs structure and some type of ratting or machine learning to match up content with leaners.

### Social ### 

Leaning seems to need relationships. I don't know why, it could be a trust thing or it could just be about engagment. If it is just about engangement then I don't think social qualifies as a core principal becouse it would only be a means to the end of engagment.

### Teaching ###

Teaching is part of leaning, this is not used in current platforms but is in classrooms. A student has to explain things with leading questions and come to conlusions on tier own to really master a subject.

### Engagment ###

Engagemnt is hard, maybee the content can be engaging. Vitual reality could really be a driver hear. But 

### Testing ###

A test driven approach to leaning could be effective. It is hard to do good testing especialy if answers can be Googled. One approach to testing that could help with this proccess is tiered testing. This can be anologus to Softare. Unit testing, use-case testing, and intigration testing - Could become multiple-choice, short answer, and interview / essay reviewd by area expert. The value of the multiple choice questions could be determined by the success in the short answer and interview/essay questions. If a question becomes easy to cheat on it won't coorilate well with the interview essay results. Subject matter experts would be rated by leaners and other subject matter experts.

### Exploration ###

The great thing about test driven leaning is the feedback. Explorative learning leaves out the the formal instructions and only provides feedback. The learner descovers concepts.

### Re-leaning ###

In order to deeply understand a concept it needs to be exposed to a person over a period of time.
