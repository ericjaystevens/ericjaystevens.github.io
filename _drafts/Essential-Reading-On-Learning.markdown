Here is a list and summery of the books that have had the biggest impact on the way I think about learning.

## Thinking Fast And Slow ##

Author: Daniel Conemen

We have 2 systems for thinking. System 1 is fast but can make mistakes. System 2 is slow and can be used to program our system.

There is a long list of irreational systematic errors that our built into the way we think.


## Habit ##

This book isn't about learning exactly, but it made me realize that using mental models is a habit. Also remembering is heavely related to using queus.

## A Mind for Numbers ##
Author: Dr. Oakley

Emphasis on using the pomodoro technic to help fight procrastination. Also chunking is a way of is a way of holding connected information together so that we can have more information in our working memmories and solve problems better.

Ephasises that slow learning is not bad learning.

## Make it Stick : The Science of Successful learning ##

Memorizing is importiint for creating mental models (seems like chunking) wich is imporataint for thinking and problem solveing.

We are bad judges at knowing how much we know, or how we learn best.

Re-reading matterial is kinda a waste of time unless a signifcant amount of time passes.

### Things that improve learning ####

Remembering and working hard to remember Things
Interleaving - learning, testing different things at the same time rather then focusing on one thing.
Spaced recall - testing yourself on something a few times afte
Connecting learning to other learned things
Testing.
